Welcome to the website of the Birmingham Autonomous Robot Club (BARC). We are a student-led club based in the Intelligent Robotics Lab, in the School of Computer Science at the University of Birmingham, and open to all members of the University of Birmingham. We develop and run demos of [intelligent robots](/robots), mostly using [ROS](http://ros.org) under [Ubuntu](http://ubuntu.org).

We are always looking for new members to join BARC. Whilst we are open to all members of the University of Birmingham (students and staff), we require members to be comfortable programming in Java, C++ or Python (or any other language supported by ROS); willing and able to devote their own time to the club (it's hard to get results when working on robots for only an hour or two a week); and prepared to learn potentially unfamiliar technologies such as Linux and ROS. If this describes you, then please [contact us](/contact) to find out about our attending our weekly meetings.
